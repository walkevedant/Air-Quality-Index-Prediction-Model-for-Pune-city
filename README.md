# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction-Model-for-Pune-city

❖ ABSTRACT
Air pollution is a major and pressing public health threat. The data used in the project is collected by Pune Smart City Development Corporation Ltd over a period of one year. Air pollution is a growing concern in Pune City, and this project aims to use data-driven analysis to understand the impact of various environmental factors on the air quality index (AQI). The project collected and analyzed data on weather conditions, traffic density, and industrial activity to identify the key contributors to air pollution in different areas of the city. Using statistical methods and data visualization techniques, the project identified the factors that significantly impact AQI and developed effective strategies and policies to mitigate the impact of air pollution on public health and the environment. The project employed exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis, time-series analysis, and deep learning techniques to predict AQI values. The findings of this study can inform policymakers, environmentalists, and other stakeholders who seek to improve air quality in Pune and other urban areas, and contribute towards creating a healthier and more sustainable living environment for the residents of Pune city.

❖ INTRODUCTION
Air pollution is a serious issue, and Pune is not immune to its effects. To assess the impact of different environmental factors on the air quality index (AQI), a project was conducted using data collected between January 2021 and January 2022. The project used various data analysis techniques, including exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and time-series analysis, to identify the key factors affecting AQI. Through these techniques, the project aimed to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing air pollution in Pune and to provide insights into potential solutions to address this growing concern. 

❖ OBJECTIVE
This project aims to utilize data-driven analysis techniques to examine the impact of various environmental factors on the air quality index in Pune City. Factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall will be analyzed to identify the key contributors to air pollution in the city. The project aims to identify targeted interventions and policies that can be implemented to improve air quality and protect public health. To achieve this, data collected by Pune Smart City Development Corporation Ltd over a period of one year will be utilized. The project will employ various techniques and analysis software to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends. By utilizing data-driven approaches, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors affecting air pollution in Pune, and to help inform policies and strategies that can effectively address this growing concern.

❖ SCOPE OF INVESTIGATION
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of environmental factors that contribute to air pollution in Pune city, and to evaluate their impact on the air quality index (AQI). The project will collect and analyze relevant data, including weather conditions, traffic density, and industrial activity, to identify the key contributors to air pollution in different areas of the city. By using statistical methods and data visualization techniques, the project aims to provide insights into the factors that significantly impact AQI and to develop effective strategies and policies to mitigate the impact of air pollution on public health and the environment. The findings of this study will be valuable for policymakers, environmentalists, and other stakeholders who seek to improve air quality in Pune and other urban areas. Overall, the project aims to contribute towards creating a healthier and more sustainable living environment for the residents of Pune city.

❖ METHODOLOGY
This project involves a series of steps to conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of environmental factors and their impact on air pollution in Pune City. The first step is to collect relevant data on environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and air pollution levels, from government websites, environmental agencies, and sensors installed in the city. The data collected should cover a period of at least 3-5 years to capture seasonal and long-term trends. The next step is to clean the data to remove any inconsistencies or errors, such as missing values, outliers, and duplicates, using software tools such as Excel, R, or Python. Exploratory data analysis is then performed to visualize and summarize the data using histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and other visualizations to explore the distribution, relationships, and patterns in the data. Correlation analysis is conducted to identify which environmental factors are strongly correlated with the air quality index, using software tools such as Excel, R, or Python to calculate correlation coefficients such as Pearson's correlation or Spearman's rank correlation. Regression analysis is then used to predict the air quality index based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. A linear regression model is built, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error, and mean absolute error, using software tools such as Excel, R, or Python. Time-series analysis is also performed to analyze the trends and patterns of air quality index over time. Time-series plots are created, and the time-series is decomposed into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Forecasting techniques are used to predict future values of the air quality index, using software tools such as Excel, R, or Python. Additionally, deep learning techniques is  used to build a prediction model. The results of these analyses can be used to develop strategies and policies to mitigate the impact of air pollution on public health and the environment in Pune City.
