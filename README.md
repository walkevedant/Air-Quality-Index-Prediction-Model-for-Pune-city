# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction-Model-for-Pune-city
## Problem Definition

Air pollution is a pressing issue that demands immediate attention in Pune City, India. The need for this project arises from the escalating levels of air pollution and its detrimental impact on public health and the environment. This section presents a detailed analysis of the need for the project, the problem statement, the objectives, the scope, and the methodology employed to address the issue effectively.

## Need of the Project

The increasing pollution levels in Pune City have become a matter of great concern for its residents and environmental authorities. The need for this project can be summarized as follows:

* Public Health Concerns: The rising levels of air pollution in Pune have been linked to a wide range of health issues, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and even premature death. It is crucial to assess the extent of air pollution and identify its key contributors to develop targeted interventions for safeguarding public health.

* Environmental Impact: Air pollution not only affects human health but also has severe consequences for the environment. The emission of pollutants from various sources contributes to climate change, ozone depletion, and ecological imbalance. Understanding the environmental impact of air pollution in Pune is vital for implementing sustainable measures to mitigate pollution levels.

* Regulatory Compliance: Pune City, like many urban areas, is subject to air quality regulations and standards set by governmental agencies. Regular monitoring and assessment of air quality are necessary to ensure compliance with these standards and take appropriate actions to reduce pollution levels.

* Future Planning and Development: Pune is a rapidly growing city with increasing industrial and vehicular activities. It is essential to evaluate the current and future trends of air pollution to inform urban planning, transportation management, and industrial regulations for sustainable development.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement for this project encapsulates the core challenge that needs to be addressed. The problem statement is defined as follows:

"The levels of air pollution in Pune City have reached critical levels, posing significant risks to public health and the environment. The problem is characterized by increasing pollutant concentrations, diverse pollution sources, and a lack of comprehensive understanding of the key contributors to air pollution. This project aims to analyze the impact of various environmental factors on the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Pune and develop effective strategies for its mitigation."

## Objectives

The objectives of the project outline the specific goals that need to be achieved to address the problem effectively. The objectives of this project are as follows:

* Identify Key Contributors: Determine the primary sources and factors contributing to air pollution in Pune City.

* Analyze Environmental Factors: Assess the impact of weather conditions, traffic density, and industrial activities on air pollution levels.

* Develop Predictive Models: Build regression models to predict the AQI based on environmental parameters and identify critical time periods for pollution mitigation.

* Evaluate Policy Implications: Provide recommendations for policy interventions and regulatory measures to control air pollution in Pune City.

* Raise Public Awareness: Communicate the health risks associated with air pollution and promote individual actions to reduce exposure.

## Scope

The scope of the project defines the boundaries and extent of the study. It clarifies what aspects will be covered and what will be excluded. The scope of this project includes:

* Analysis of Air Quality Index (AQI): The project focuses on analyzing the AQI as an indicator of air pollution levels in Pune City.

* Environmental Factors: The study examines the influence of weather conditions, traffic density, and industrial activities on air pollution.

* Data Collection and Analysis: The project utilizes a wide range of data sources to collect and analyze relevant information on air quality and pollution sources.

* Policy Recommendations: The project provides recommendations for policy interventions and regulatory measures to mitigate air pollution in Pune City.

* Public Awareness: The project emphasizes the importance of public awareness and individual actions to reduce pollution exposure and promote a healthy environment.

## Methodology

The methodology section outlines the approach and techniques used to achieve the project objectives. The methodology for this project includes the following steps:

* Data Collection: Collect a comprehensive dataset comprising air quality measurements, meteorological data, traffic density information, and industrial emission records.

* Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure its accuracy and suitability for analysis.

* Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the patterns, trends, and distributions of air pollution levels and environmental factors.

* Correlation Analysis: Evaluate the relationships between environmental factors and air pollution levels to identify significant correlations.

* Regression Analysis: Develop regression models to predict the AQI based on weather conditions, traffic density, and industrial activities.

* Policy Recommendations: Formulate policy recommendations based on the study findings, taking into account the specific characteristics and needs of 
  Pune City.

Public Awareness Campaign: Develop strategies to raise public awareness about the health risks associated with air pollution and promote individual actions for pollution reduction.

By following this methodology, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of air pollution in Pune City and propose effective strategies for its mitigation.
